               <p>Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines characterised by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield. "Turtle" may refer to the order as a whole or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling testudines. The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists uses "Turtle" to describe all species of the order Testudines, regardless of whether they are land-dwelling or sea-dwelling, and uses "Tortoise" as a more specific term for slow-moving terrestrial species. General American usage agrees; turtle is often a general term; tortoise is used only in reference to terrestrial turtles or, more narrowly, only those members of Testudinidae, the family of modern land tortoises; and terrapin may refer to turtles that are small and live in fresh and brackish water, in particular the diamondback terrapin. In America, for example, the members of the genus Terrapene dwell on land, yet are referred to as box turtles rather than tortoises. Land tortoises are not native to Australia, yet traditionally freshwater turtles have been called "Tortoises" in Australia. Some Australian experts disapprove of this usage-believing that the term tortoises is "Better confined to purely terrestrial animals with very different habits and needs, none of which are found in this country"-and promote the use of the term "Freshwater turtle" to describe Australia's primarily aquatic members of the order Testudines because it avoids misleading use of the word "Tortoise" and also is a useful distinction from marine turtles.</p>
               <p>The largest sea turtle species is the leatherback turtle. The largest freshwater turtle in North America is the alligator snapping turtle. The Yangtze giant softshell turtle is the largest softshell turtle. The African helmeted turtle is the most common turtle in Africa, according to Animal Planet. The cooter turtle is mostly vegetarian, and the green sea turtle only eats grasses and algae. Due to rising temperatures, too many sea turtle females are being born, contributing to the decline in species numbers, according to the Sea Turtle Conservancy. The now-extinct Desmatochelys padillai turtle skeleton was found in Villa de Leyva, Colombia, and is 25 million years older than the Santanachelys gaffneyi turtle from Brazil that previously held the record for the world's oldest sea turtle fossil.</p>
